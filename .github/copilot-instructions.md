# ESPIR Project - Copilot Instructions

This is a comprehensive IR blaster project with three main components:

## Project Components
1. **ESPIR-FW**: ESP32 Arduino firmware with IRremoteESP8266 library and BLE connectivity
2. **ESPIR-App**: Android application for device control and IR code management  
3. **ESPIR-HW**: Hardware design with ESP32, IR LED with MOSFET driver, and IR receiver

## Development Guidelines
- Use Arduino IDE/PlatformIO for ESP32 firmware development
- Follow Android development best practices for the mobile app
- Maintain clear separation between hardware abstraction and application logic
- Document all IR protocols and device configurations
- Implement robust BLE communication protocols

## Code Style
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Comment complex IR timing and BLE protocol implementations
- Follow embedded systems best practices for memory management
- Implement proper error handling for wireless communications

This project focuses on creating a professional-grade IR blaster system with mobile control capabilities.
