# ESPIR Design Decisions and Questions

## Overview
This document outlines key design decisions made during the ESPIR project implementation and identifies areas where you may want to customize or provide additional specifications.

## üìã Design Decisions Made

### 1. Communication Protocol
**Decision**: JSON over BLE GATT characteristic
- **Rationale**: Human-readable, widely supported, easy to debug
- **Alternative**: Binary protocol for efficiency
- **Customization Needed**: You may want to optimize for speed vs. readability

### 2. IR Code Storage Format
**Decision**: JSON serialization with protocol-specific fields
- **Current Implementation**: Stores protocol type, value, bits, and raw data
- **Question for You**: Do you need support for specific IR protocols beyond NEC, Sony, RC5, RC6?

### 3. Device Profile Schema
**Decision**: Simple hierarchical structure (Device -> Commands)
- **Fields**: name, type, manufacturer, model, commands[]
- **Question for You**: Do you need additional metadata fields (room, category, icon, etc.)?

Answer: Nope, a simple heirarchy is fine.

### 4. BLE Security
**Decision**: Basic pairing without additional encryption
- **Current**: Standard BLE pairing
- **Question for You**: Do you need additional security layers for sensitive environments?

Answer: Nope, this will be used in the general public environment, no special security concerns. Ease of use is critical.

### 5. Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Graceful degradation with user feedback
- **Firmware**: Watchdog timers, status LEDs, serial logging
- **Android**: User notifications, offline mode, crash recovery
- **Question for You**: What specific error scenarios are most critical for your use case?

## üîß Implementation Details Requiring Your Input

### 1. IR Protocol Support
```cpp
// Current protocols supported:
// - NEC, Sony, RC5, RC6, Raw
// 
// Question: Do you need support for:
// - Samsung, LG, Panasonic protocols?
// - Custom/proprietary protocols?
// - Air conditioner protocols (complex state)?
```
Answer: The basics is fine.

### 2. Device Categories
```kotlin
// Current device types are free-form strings
// 
// Question: Should we use predefined categories?
// - Television, Audio, Climate, Lighting, etc.
// - Custom icons for each category?
// - Room-based organization?
```
Answer: Free-form is fine.

### 3. User Interface Preferences
```xml
<!-- Current UI is basic Material Design -->
<!-- 
Question: Do you prefer:
- Dark/Light theme preference?
- Custom color schemes?
- Advanced vs. Simple mode?
- Tablet-specific layouts?
-->
```

Answer: Dark/light toggle would be excellent. No other special features required. Priority should be ease of use.

### 4. Hardware Customizations
```
Current Design:
- Single IR LED with MOSFET driver
- 38kHz carrier frequency
- GPIO4 (TX), GPIO5 (RX), GPIO2 (Status)

Questions:
- Do you need multiple IR LEDs for wider coverage?
- Different carrier frequencies for specific devices?
- Additional I/O for sensors or displays?
- Battery operation requirements?
```

Answer: Not at this time. Some of these may be considered for the future.

### 5. Cloud Integration
```
Current: Local-only operation

Questions:
- Do you want cloud backup of device profiles?
- Remote control capability over internet?
- Device sharing between users?
- Analytics and usage tracking?
```

Answer: None of these are necessary at this time.

### 6. Advanced Features
```
Potential Enhancements:

1. Macro Commands
   - Sequence multiple IR commands
   - Delays between commands
   - Conditional logic

2. Voice Control
   - Integration with Google Assistant/Alexa
   - Voice command recognition

3. Automation
   - Time-based triggers
   - Sensor-based automation
   - Integration with home automation systems

4. Learning Intelligence
   - Automatic device recognition
   - Usage pattern learning
   - Command optimization

Question: Which of these features are priorities?
```

Answer: Priority should be given to basic functionality and ease of use.
